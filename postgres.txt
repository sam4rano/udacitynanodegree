psql –U postgres
Here, “postgres” represents the default 
username for the PostgreSQL server. 
During the installation of the PostgreSQL 
server, and even after that, you can create
 a new user. However, since we did not 
 create any new user for our PostgreSQL 
 server, we will have to access the 
 PostgreSQL environment through the 
 user-created by default during the 
 installation. If you have also not 
 created a new user, then your default 
 username will also be “postgres”
